            <h1>This is a Venezuelan Poodle Moth</h1>

            <h3><b>Main Content</b></h3>
            <p>The Venezuelan poodle moth is a moth photographed in 2009 by Kyrgyzstani zoologist Dr. Arthur Anker in the Gran Sabana region of Venezuela.

                The name derives from a comparison of its physical appearance to a cross between a moth and a poodle. Dr. Anker took a total of 75 photos of the extraordinary species, yet only a few are available to view.</p>

            <h3><b>Classification</b></h3>
            <p>Anker and another scientist hypothesized it could be a member of the genus Artace. The moth is often confused online with images of other furry moths, such as Bombyx mori, while "one of Shuker's colleagues speculated that the Venezuelan poodle moth bears some small resemblance to Diaphora mendica."

                Measurements derived from Dr. Anker's photographs show the unique Lepidoptera to be about 1 in (2.5 cm) in length. The physical appearance and dearth of actual information has led to its being touted as a hoax on the internet. Subsequent expeditions to the region have been unable to spot the moth again.</p>

            <h3><b>Habitat</b></h3>
            <p>To date, the only known examples of the Venezuelan poodle moth live in Venezuela, South America, in the Canaima National Park. The region includes diverse habitat types, including moist forest and high rock plateaus known as tepuis.</p>
